# usb-imager
A simple gui for writing image and ISO files to usb drives. It currently doesn't work yet.

## Requirements
The following software is required to be installed:

- python3
- pyudev
- pygobject

## TODO
Since the usb-image application is not yet done, here is a TODO list:
- Track progress
- Unmount partitions before writing
- Ask for confirmation
- Wait with showing the progress bar until dd has started
- Notify the user when imaging is done
- Add support for making backups
